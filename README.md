I am a software developer who is passionate about enjoying life, being myself and happy, and contribute to other lives in the universe. At the same time, I am a social economist who see the difficulties and barriers for people to be free and happy, and develop projects for them. Finally, I am a photographer who observes people, community, and nature. I am working to have a better world and a better life with all of people as a part of the nature.
